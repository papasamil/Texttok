# texttok

> It’s about time ASCII terminals caught up with the rest of the world. We’ve created texttok: the hit new terminal-art media sharing platform where people can view and vote on their favourite text-based pictures!

Your task is to implement a client for a simple network service. 

This pack includes the API specification and server details. You can use any language you like. Once you’re happy with your code, commit to to this repository and push it up to the server.

As an optional extension, if you use the service for a while you might find a hidden secret. You can also commit code which reveal that secret.
